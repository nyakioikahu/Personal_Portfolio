                <p>Honestly, the JKUAT youth in stem program was the very first time I began coding.  I am a beginner coder with a strong passion for learning and problem-solving. My journey into coding began with the JKUAT Youth in STEM program, where I am currently learning the fundamentals of programming. With a background as a mathlete in high school, I have always loved numbers and logical reasoning, which naturally led me to explore data science.</p>

            <div class="about-me-text-2">
                <p>My interest in software engineering stems from my love for challenges and my ability to approach problems analytically. As a former music student, I understand the power of structure and creativity‚Äîtwo essential skills in both music and coding. Whether it's solving a tough algorithm or debugging a stubborn piece of code, I thrive on figuring things out independently before seeking help.</p>

            <div class="about-me-text-3">
                <p>Aspiring to become a data scientist, I am committed to continuously expanding my knowledge and honing my skills. I believe that data holds the key to making informed decisions, and I am excited to be on this journey of learning how to harness its power effectively.</p>

        <div class="personal-story-text">
            <p>Growing up, I was always drawn to the thrill of solving puzzles and unraveling mysteries. One of the most memorable experiences was a large-scale treasure hunt organized by Parklands Sports Club. With competitors of all ages, it was an exhilarating race that required sharp thinking and quick decision-making.
                During the event, each clue presented a puzzle that demanded a combination of lateral thinking and logical deduction. I remember one challenge where I solved a coded message by spotting common patterns and linking them to the event's theme, which led me to the next location.
                My efforts paid off, and I emerged as the winner of the treasure hunt, earning an unforgettable trip to Mombasa. This experience solidified my belief in the power of combining logic and creativity to overcome challenges.
